# Follow-Up Frameworks - MWA Master Closer

A) Curiosity Reignite (after they saw the video or post once)
1) "Did you get a chance to watch that 12 min video? Most people message me at minute 7."
2) "Sharing a quick win: someone plugged in this morning. Thought of you."
3) "Want me to resend the link?"

B) Timing Touch (when life is busy)
1) "You mentioned waiting until things settle - I used to say that too."
2) "What if this is the thing that makes things settle?"
3) "If I send the link now, would you start with 0 dollars down and get momentum rolling?"

C) Posture Play (final nudge)
1) "Before I close my list for the week, want me to hold your spot?"
2) "Most start with Klarna 0 dollars down to keep it simple."
3) "Link with or without the payment plan?"
