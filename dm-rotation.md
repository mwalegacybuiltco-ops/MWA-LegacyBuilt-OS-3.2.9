# 7-Day DM Rotation - MWA Master Closer (3-7/day)

Use this weekly. Each day has: an opener, a mid-convo nudge, a close, one voice-note idea and an objection flip.

---
## Day 1 - Connection Start
Opener: "Hey [Name]! I saw you on my story - are you building something online already or just exploring?"
Nudge: "If you could change one thing about your income in the next 90 days, what would it be?"
Close: "Based on what you said, the Elite Founders Bundle is the fastest path. Want me to send the short video that explains it?"
Voice Note: Your 30-sec origin: "I was stuck until I plugged into LWA - structure created momentum."
Objection Flip (time): "That is why this exists - to give your time back."

## Day 2 - Proof and Path
Opener: "Your comment hit me - sounds like you are ready for a simpler path."
Nudge: "Most people do not need more time, they need a plan that actually fits their life."
Close: "Let us set you up today. Do you want the link with or without the payment plan?"
Voice Note: Calm certainty: "I help you get clarity, then clicks turn into commissions."
Objection Flip (money): "Staying where I was was costing more than 699 dollars - that is what I realized."

## Day 3 - Future Pace
Opener: "Imagine 30 days from now: what would 'worth it' look like to you?"
Nudge: "We will reverse-engineer that together. You will not be guessing alone."
Close: "If I send the link now, can you plug in while you have got momentum?"
Voice Note: "You are closer than you think. We will keep it simple and focused."
Objection Flip (overwhelm): "We start small: setup -> one traffic lane -> first commissions."

## Day 4 - Pattern Break
Opener: "Real talk - has waiting made it easier or harder?"
Nudge: "Comfort is not clarity. Deciding creates clarity."
Close: "Let us make this the day you stop watching and start earning."
Voice Note: "I lead with truth, not pressure. I care about your results."
Objection Flip (fear): "Fear is the price of entry to your next level."

## Day 5 - Posture and Options
Opener: "I am closing my weekly list soon - want me to save you a spot?"
Nudge: "Most start with Klarna 0 dollars down to keep it light."
Close: "Link with or without payment plan?"
Voice Note: "I will walk you through step one so you feel sure."
Objection Flip (spouse): "Totally - what would help them feel safe about the decision?"

## Day 6 - Social Proof
Opener: "Quick win: [mini proof or win]. That is why I thought of you."
Nudge: "When would you like your first small win to hit?"
Close: "Ready to plug in and get this moving today?"
Voice Note: "Momentum loves speed - I will keep it simple."
Objection Flip (past attempts): "This is not another course; it is a guided system."

## Day 7 - Gentle Deadline
Opener: "I am about to batch my onboarding - want me to include you?"
Nudge: "If the video answered 80 percent, I can fill the last 20 percent in DM."
Close: "I can send the link now and hold your spot."
Voice Note: "Proud of you for exploring this - let us make it yours."
Objection Flip (need to think): "What part are you hoping to feel more certain about?"
